I am a Physics graduate with 3 years of experience in R&D engineering and embedded SW and HW development. I am interested in researching the potentials and pitfalls of Artifical Intelligence, with the goal of enabling safe, reliable and beneficial AI that can be seemlesly integrated in society. During my MSc in Data Science at the University of Potsdam I want to dive into the explainability of Machine Learning models.
