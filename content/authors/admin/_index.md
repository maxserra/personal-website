I am a Physics graduate turned Data Scientist with 5+ years of working experience in industrial R&D and Data Science. I am passionate about RL, causal AI and the opportunities that GenAI is unlocking. I have worked on the end-to-end development of an IoT product, led a small team at 22 and hosted a series of workshops for the FactoryPal Data Science team. With an analytical mindset, I always strive to understand the bigger picture to solve problems pragmatically. I am a proactive person with a social conscience who loves to leverage data to make a positive difference.
